Simple Calculator   01/10/15

1.Open the android Studio  and import the "Calculator" workspace into it.

2.If there's a device or emulator already running and its AVD configuration meets the requirements of the application's build target, the application is installed and
 run upon it.

3.If there's more than one device or emulator running, each of which meets the requirements of the build target, a device chooser is shown to let you select which
 device to use.

4.If there are no devices or emulators running that meet the requirements of the build target, Android Studio looks at the available AVDs. If there is an AVD that
 matches the build target of the project, Android Studio chooses that AVD. If the AVD versions are newer than the build target of the project, Android Studio chooses
 the oldest possible version of an AVD that meets the project or module build target requirement.

5.Run the application on a virtual emulator device or a mobile device and you are good to implement simple math operations like addtion,subtraction,multiplication and
 division.
